# WebSim SaueracleOS

SaueracleOS is a set of tools that use the WebSim generative API to generate Sauerbraten related content.

WebSim currently only allows one file per page, so everything is crammed into SaueracleOS.html.


## Server Browser
It uses the SauerTracker API to get the active servers, and then the generative API to create an interface that displays information from those servers.

## Cubicle Chat
A Discord-like chat filled with fictional players pretending to discuss Sauerbraten from a parallel universe, you can try (and probably fail) to reveal the truth to them.

## LoopFiles - File Explorer
What if you gained access to a computer from that parallel universe?<br>
LoopFiles lets you create and explore endless folders with endless files inspired by a fictional Cube Engine.

## Josias The Mapper
Josias is the true protagonist of SaueracleOS, he is able to generate mathematical formulas from your wishes and then use them to create a true piece of art in map format.

Additionally, the files generated by Josias can be modified from the `SaueracleOS/JSOCTA` folder in LoopFiles, they are identified by the .jsocta extension and have a button to be converted to .OGZ.
